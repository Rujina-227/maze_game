Project Title: Maze Game with Enemy Chase

Description:
This project is a console-based maze game written in C++. The game features a player character ('H') navigating through a maze, collecting dots ('.') to score points. However, the player must be cautious as an enemy character ('E') follows a strategic path to catch the player. The enemy's movement is determined by a breadth-first search algorithm, providing an engaging challenge for the player.

Features:

Player Movement: Use arrow keys to move the player character through the maze.
Scoring: Collect dots to increase your score.
Enemy Chase: The enemy character intelligently follows a path to catch the player.
Difficulty Levels: Choose from different difficulty levels (Hard, Normal, Easy) to adjust the speed and challenge.
How to Play:

Navigate through the maze using arrow keys.
Collect dots to score points.
Avoid getting caught by the enemy character.
Choose the difficulty level at the beginning of the game.
Instructions:

Arrow Keys: Move the player character (H).
Dots (.) increase your score.
Avoid contact with the enemy character (E).
Difficulty levels: H (Hard), N (Normal), E (Easy).
Note:
This project showcases fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including console input/output, array manipulation, and basic game logic implementation. It provides an opportunity for further enhancement with additional features and improvements.
